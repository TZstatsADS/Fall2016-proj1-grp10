### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Sample project README statement.

Project Project1

Team members: Han Cui, Chi Zhang, Xuechun Sun, Jiayi Wang

Summary: We seek to find out features that may affect peopleâ€™s marriage status. We choose 'marital status' and 'number of times married' as measurement of a person's performance on marriage. By relating this to other factors, such as income, eduction level, or health status, we find some patterns upon them. We use data visualization such as mosaic plot, bar chart and sankey diagram to find patterns among each factor.

[Contribution Statement] 
All team members designed the study.
Chi, Xuechun, Jiayi explored feature engineering and cleaned data for the model. 
Han created parallel coordinates plot, d3 parallel coordinates plot, bar charts and box plots.
Xuechun created the mosaic plot.
Jiayi summarized rmarkdown files.
All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
