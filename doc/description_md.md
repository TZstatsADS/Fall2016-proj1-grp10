"In the name of God, I, take you, to be my husband/wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish all the days of my life. This is my solemn vow."

Fac=3: If the number of times married is three or more times, or that number is two and the marital status is divorced now, then we think this person does not perform well in marriage.

Fac=2: If the number of times married is one time and now the marital status is divorced now, or that number is two and the marital status is not divorced now, then we think this person perform not bad in marriage.

Fac=1: If the number of times married is one time and now the marital status is not divorced now, we think this person does very well in marriage.


Introduction
In this project, we want to see some general features that may decide people’s marriages. And then we are interested in whether people can perform as well as they vow in the wedding.

Then we can give some suggestions to peers, for example, does high income help people keep marriage steady? Should we listen to parents’ suggestions to break up with boyfriend who has a severe disease or disability? Is it a good idea to get married with a person who has high education degree?

Our goal is to find some factors that may bring negative effects to marriages, so we can help people avoid them. And at the same time, we hope peers can understand the risk when they fall in love with someone with some not good aspects but ignore some potential factors.
