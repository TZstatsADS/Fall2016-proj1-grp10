+ Project summary: We seek to find out features that may affect people’s marriage status. We choose 'marital status' and 'number of times married' as measurement of a person's performance on marriage. By relating this to other factors, such as income, eduction level, or health status, we find some patterns upon them. We use data visualization such as mosaic plot, bar chart and sankey diagram to find patterns among each factor.
